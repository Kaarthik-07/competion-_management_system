## Backend Setup

To get started with the backend server, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
npm install cors express mongoose nodemon
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure you create a `.env` file in the root of your backend directory with the following content:

```env
ATLAS_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### Running the Server

To run the server, navigate to the backend directory and execute:

```bash
npm run server
```

This will start the server on port 6967, listening for requests.

## Frontend Setup

For the frontend application, you'll need to set up a new project and install the required dependencies.

### Creating the Project

```bash
npm create vite@latest your_project_name --template react
cd your_project_name
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install Tailwind CSS for styling and Axios for making HTTP requests.

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
npm install axios
```

### Configure Tailwind

Modify your `tailwind.config.js` file to enable the styles you plan to use. Tailwind's documentation provides comprehensive guidance on this.

### Running the Application

Start your React application by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will serve your application on a local development server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Making Requests

The frontend application uses Axios to make POST requests to the backend. Ensure the backend server is running before attempting to submit the form from the frontend.
